# Annotation Analysis


>"The author, Baker, used an interesting approach to represent the way in which different business categories congregated in different areas; as he points out later in the paragraph. By organizing each business category into coloured groups, the reader is able to differentiate where the majority of each business was located with respect to the Thames." - liveash_02 

The annotation was used to describe the following graphs attached in *“The Soft Digital History That Underpins My Book”* by Jw Baker.

I think the most interesting annotation so far i've read was from the introduction week in the *“The Soft Digital History That Underpins My Book” by Jw Baker.* **liveash_02** points out that the graphs he created were interesting and by using different colors, he was able to differentiate the data that he was representing. I just thought this was interesting because I had a tough time understanding what he was going for. I would not have been able to understand what his intentions were if I had not read the description and even then, I had to write it over to try and relate and compare what he was going for. The annotation interested me because it shows how people perceive and analysis work differently, maybe this was enough for the person in the sense that reading the context once, and than looking at his visual representation was a good scheme of approaching representing the work. It’s interesting and important to see how a general audience reads work, because when your publishing work for others to see, you need to consider a general audience and not just what you specifically would see. The annotation just made me think how others perceive and understand information.
